    holidaysInDutch {.used.}: seq[Holiday] = Netherlands.getHolidays(2024, Dutch)

for holiday in holidaysInEnglish:

        &" and goes on for " & $holiday.duration.inDays() & " day(s)!"

import std/[strformat]
import holidapi/country/europe/germany

import holidapi/country/europe/germany_alt

const
    year: int = 2024

for state, holidays in response:
    echo &"Holidays for state {state}:"
    for i, holiday in holidays:
        echo &"{i}: {holiday.name}"
```
